# Slack Clone
I made a chat application similar to slack. I have used NextJS along with tailwindCSS and prisma ORM. I have used socket.io for the bilateral communication of a client and the server. 

# Setup
Clone the repo.
```
    git clone <repo_link>
```

Install the packages and start the app
```
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

Add relevant variables inside your .env
```
